Notes:
You'll need to edit the PGPSample.exe.config file to point to your files to make this work.

The PGPSample.exe program is a console application, that should at least tell you what's going on.

When it fails, it will want to let Microsoft know about the problems. You are certainly welcome to do so, but I doubt they'll care.

I'm happy to help and aswer questions - so drop me a line.
